                <h2>Greetings.</h2>
                <p>My name is Koen Kreijkamp, and this is my website. Thank you for visiting and please enjoy your stay.</p>

                    <h3>"Cheese"</h3>
                    <p class="skill-text">I'll be honest, I don't know if cheese classifies as a skill, but if it does I woould be fantastic at it. In cheese I would be up there with the big cheese men. I don't mean to sound arrogant or overconfident, but I truly belive that I would be a contender for the top five 'cheesers' if not in the top three. If it is not yet aparant to you, I am filling space, because the area looks weird with too little text.</p>

                    <h3>Solving the Rubiks Cube</h3>
                    <p class="skill-text">One of my few "skills" is solving the rubiks cube. I write the word skills in quotation marks to emphasize my skeptism for the following reasons: I don't think that solving a rubiks cube is a skill; and it has helped me in exactly zero life situations. Besides this even if it would be considered a skill, i would not be considered particularily skilled at it. I am again writing this as filler text, because the classic "lorem ipsum sit amet" seemed so boring.</p>

                    <h3>Baguette</h3>
                    <p class="skill-text">This is a Baguette. Cheese is enjoyable when served on baguettes. Cheese is also enjoyable when not served on a baguette. I would like a Baguette right now. As I am writing this third "skill", it has come to my attention that I have not put any proper skills here.  :(. Oh well. At least this site is acurate to myself.</p>
